# SU Women's Lacrosse — AI “Deep Fake” Interview

## Project Overview

This project transforms Syracuse University Women’s Lacrosse 2024 season statistics into a short, AI-generated video interview using Vidnoz AI. The video features a fictional reporter and team captain discussing data-backed insights such as scoring efficiency, possession, and game outcomes. The goal was to show how raw statistics can be repurposed into an engaging narrative with visuals, captions, and clear ethics labeling.

## Planning Process

Data Review — Identified key stats (e.g., points per game, shooting %, clears, win/loss goal averages).

Scriptwriting — Converted stats into natural Q&A dialogue (16 short scenes).

Visual Planning — Created a B-roll shot list and stat cards to reinforce spoken lines.

Tool Selection — Chose Vidnoz AI for free 3-minute video generation with avatars, captions, and stock visuals.

Production — Built scenes, assigned avatars, added captions/overlays, and inserted disclosure cards.

Validation — Ensured stats matched the dataset, pacing stayed dynamic, and ethics labels were included.
